After a BFD negotiation timeout period is configured, the BFD negotiation timeout timer is started when the BFD session goes Down (the event is not triggered through detecting a link fault). If the timer has expired but the BFD session is still Down, the service associated with the BFD session is notified of the BFD session Down event."
