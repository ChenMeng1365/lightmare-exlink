An RPF interface and an RPF neighbor can be specified for a packet source on the local device by configuring a multicast static route. Multicast static routes can provide two functions in different scenarios:\n1. Changing an RPF route: When the multicast topology is the same as the unicast topology on a network, the paths for transmitting multicast data are consistent with that for transmitting unicast data. The RPF route can be configured as a multicast route to work as a transmission path different from unicast transmission paths.\n2. Connecting an RPF route: This method is used on a network where unicast routes are blocked, no multicast static route is configured, and therefore no RFP route can be used to forward packets. An RPF multicast static route can be configured after an RPF check, and then can be used to forward packets.",

An RPF interface and an RPF neighbor can be specified for a packet source on the local device by configuring a multicast static route. Multicast static routes can provide two functions in different scenarios:\n1. Changing an RPF route: When the multicast topology is the same as the unicast topology on a network, the paths for transmitting multicast data are consistent with that for transmitting unicast data. The RPF route can be configured as a multicast route to work as a transmission path different from unicast transmission paths.\n2. Connecting an RPF route: This method is used on a network where unicast routes are blocked, no multicast static route is configured, and therefore no RFP route can be used to forward packets. An RPF multicast static route can be configured after an RPF check, and then can be used to forward packets.",

An RPF interface and an RPF neighbor can be specified for a packet source on the local device by configuring a multicast static route. Multicast static routes can provide two functions in different scenarios:\n1. Changing an RPF route: When the multicast topology is the same as the unicast topology on a network, the paths for transmitting multicast data are consistent with that for transmitting unicast data. The RPF route can be configured as a multicast route to work as a transmission path different from unicast transmission paths.\n2. Connecting an RPF route: This method is used on a network where unicast routes are blocked, no multicast static route is configured, and therefore no RFP route can be used to forward packets. An RPF multicast static route can be configured after an RPF check, and then can be used to forward packets.",

An RPF interface and an RPF neighbor can be specified for a packet source on the local device by configuring a multicast static route. Multicast static routes can provide two functions in different scenarios:\n1. Changing an RPF route: When the multicast topology is the same as the unicast topology on a network, the paths for transmitting multicast data are consistent with that for transmitting unicast data. The RPF route can be configured as a multicast route to work as a transmission path different from unicast transmission paths.\n2. Connecting an RPF route: This method is used on a network where unicast routes are blocked, no multicast static route is configured, and therefore no RFP route can be used to forward packets. An RPF multicast static route can be configured after an RPF check, and then can be used to forward packets.",

Changing an RPF route: When the multicast topology is the same as the unicast topology on a network, the paths for transmitting multicast data are consistent with that for transmitting unicast data. The RPF route can be configured as a multicast route to work as a transmission path different from unicast transmission paths.\n2. Connecting an RPF route: This method is used on a network where unicast routes are blocked, no multicast static route is configured, and therefore no RFP route can be used to forward packets. An RPF multicast static route can be configured after an RPF check, and then can be used to forward packets.",
