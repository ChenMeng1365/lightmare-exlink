The password can contain letters, numbers, and special characters. Chinese characters are not supported. The minimum length and complexity of a user password are restricted by pwd-min-length, security-policy, complexity-check, and forbidden-word. When security-policy is set to true, the minimum length of a password is 8 characters. In addition, complexity verification is enabled. The complexity requirements are as follows: (1) A password must contain digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. Spaces and question marks are not supported. If the password is enclosed in quotation marks, spaces are allowed in the password. (2) The password cannot contain an account or the reverse string of an account. (3) The new password cannot be the same as any of the previous 10 passwords. (If the new password is the same as the current password, the new password is also considered as a history password. That is, the current password is included in the 10 history passwords.) This parameter takes effect when the password complexity check is enabled (complexity-check is set to true). If forbidden-word is configured, the password cannot contain forbidden words. If only the pwd-min-length value is set, the pwd-min-length setting takes effect. If the minimum length of a user password is set and the user security policy is enabled, the minimum length of a password cannot be less than 8 characters. If the minimum length of a password is set and the pwd-min-length value is greater than 8 characters, the minimum length of a password is determined by the pwd-min-length value."
