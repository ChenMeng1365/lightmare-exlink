A policy rule may select a\npath-selection-group as the egress for a particular type of\ntraffic (e.g., DSCP value). The system then utilises its\nstandard forwarding lookup mechanism to select from the\npaths that are specified within the group - for IP packets,\nthe destination IP address is used such that the packet is\nrouted to the entity within the path-selection-group that\ncorresponds to the next-hop for the destination IP address\nof the packet; for L2 packets, the selection is based on the\ndestination MAC address. If multiple paths within the\nselection group are eligible to be used for forwarding,\nthe packets are load-balanced between them according to\nthe system's usual load balancing logic.",
