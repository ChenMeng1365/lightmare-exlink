If a suppression policy for route dampening is configured, routes are preferentially matched against the suppression parameters defined in the suppression policy. If no parameter is configured, the default value of each parameter is used. The four route dampening parameters are mutually dependent. If you configure one of the parameters, the other parameters also need to be configured. When you configure BGP route dampening, the values of reuse threshold, suppress threshold, and penalty ceiling must meet the inequality of reuse threshold < suppress threshold < penalty ceiling. If Maximum suppression time obtained by using the formula of Maximum suppression time = Half life (of reachable routes) x 60 x (ln (Penalty ceiling/Reuse threshold)/ln(2)) is smaller than 1, suppression cannot be performed. Ensure that the value of the maximum suppression time is equal to or greater than 1. This means that the value of the penalty ceiling/reuse threshold must be great enough.",
