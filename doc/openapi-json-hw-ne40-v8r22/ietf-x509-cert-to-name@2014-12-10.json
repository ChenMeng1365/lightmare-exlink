The cert-to-name entry's fingerprint\ndetermines whether the list entry is a match:\n\n1) If the cert-to-name list entry's fingerprint value\n   matches that of the presented certificate, then consider\n   the list entry a successful match.\n\n2) If the cert-to-name list entry's fingerprint value\n   matches that of a locally held copy of a trusted CA\n   certificate, and that CA certificate was part of the CA\n   certificate chain to the presented certificate, then\n   consider the list entry a successful match.\n\nOnce a matching cert-to-name list entry has been found, the\nmap-type is used to determine how the name associated with\nthe certificate should be determined.  See the map-type\nleaf's description for details on determining the name value.\nIf it is impossible to determine a name from the cert-to-name\nlist entry's data combined with the data presented in the\ncertificate, then additional cert-to-name list entries MUST\nbe searched to look for another potential match.\n\nSecurity administrators are encouraged to make use of\ncertificates with subjectAltName fields that can be mapped to\nnames so that a single root CA certificate can allow all\nchild certificates' subjectAltName fields to map directly to\na name via a 1:1 transformation.",
